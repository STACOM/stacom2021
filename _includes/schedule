|9:10 UTC | **From Spins to Pictures to Digital Organs and Back**<br>Keynote speaker: Sebastian Kozerke, Professor of Biomedical Imaging, ETH Zurich<br><br>![image-left]({{ "/images/kozerke.png" | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; border-radius: 50%; margin-right: 10px;"}Among the diagnostic imaging modalities, Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging stands out as it offers a wealth of contrast mechanisms. Using bipolar magnetic field gradients, motion of spins can be encoded. Depending on the scale or range of motion, modulations of image magnitude or phase can be detected. Coherent motion, as for example found with blood flow in larger vessels, is readily quantifiable as a phase change in the images while incoherent or stochastic motion, as with diffusing water in tissue, is detectable as image voxel-based magnitude attenuation. While both types of motion are encoded with essentially the same MR experiment, they offer very distinct insights into in-vivo anatomy and function.<br><br>![image-left]({{ "/images/kozerke-talk.png" | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; margin-right: 10px; width: 300px;"}Beyond motion-sensitive imaging, metabolic MR imaging offers yet another angle of capturing the complex interplay of mechanisms in-vivo. While MR has profited from the abundance of water in the human body, probing non-proton substrates has turned out very challenging given the low polarization of non-proton nuclei, the low concentration of non-proton-based substrates such as organic molecules and the limited sensitivity of detecting non-proton compounds. With break-through advances in dissolution Dynamic Nuclear Polarization (DNP) technology a new era has started allowing for real-time MR imaging of key metabolic substrates in the in-vivo heart and other organs.<br><br>In this presentation, we will discuss the importance of understanding the interplay of substrate supply, substrate metabolism and function of the heart. It will be demonstrated that changes in metabolic turnover present early hallmarks of deranging function as seen for example in heart failure. In the presentation the basic ideas of encoding flow, diffusion and metabolic information will be conveyed and critically discussed. The importance of discriminating between an analog encoding realm versus digital inference will be stressed and set in contrast to common beliefs in voxel-based information as it is currently witnessed with machine learning based image classifications. We will show the role of MR image-guided digital organs for inferring sub-voxel information from in-vivo measurements and will paint a future scenario of patient-specific in-silico diagnostics and prediction including approaches to optimal experimental design of imaging.
