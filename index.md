The **Statistical Atlases and Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM)** workshop has been running annually at MICCAI since 2010. The 12th edition of STACOM workshop is going to be held in conjunction with the [MICCAI 2021](https://miccai2021.org/) in Strasbourg, France. The STACOM workshop is aiming to create a collaborative forum for young/senior researchers (engineers, biophysicists, mathematicians) and clinicians, working on: statistical analysis of cardiac morphology and dynamics, computational modelling of the heart and fluid dynamics, data/models sharing, personalisation of cardiac electro-mechanical models, quantitative image analysis and translational methods into clinical practice.

## Awards

Congratulations to **Claudia Nagel** from Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, for the best oral presenter award; and to **Gabriel Bernardino** from CREATIS, France, the Netherlands, for the best poster presenter award.

## Keynote speaker

*From Spins to Pictures to Digital Organs and Back*

**Sebastian Kozerke**<br>Professor of Biomedical Imaging, ETH Zurich

![image-center]({{ "/images/kozerke.png" | relative_url }}){: style="float: left; border-radius: 80%; margin-right: 10px;"}
Sebastian Kozerke, PhD, is a Professor of Biomedical Imaging at the Institute for Biomedical Engineering of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich (ETH Zurich), Switzerland, where he leads the Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance research.

Sebastian studied Electrical and Biomedical Engineering. He obtained his PhD degree and the Venia legendi from ETH Zurich in 2000 and 2005, respectively. In 2002-03 he was a research associate at the Division of Imaging Sciences at King’s College London, UK. In 2003 he founded the startup company GyroTools LLC to help translating imaging research into applicable prototypes for MR experimentalists and clinicians. He was recruited as a Professor and Chair of MR physics at King’s College London in 2008 before being promoted to Professor at the University of Zurich in 2010. In 2014 he was elected to the rank of a Full Professor at ETH Zurich where he heads the [Biomedical Imaging laboratory](http://www.cmr.ethz.ch/), serves as the chair of the Center for Experimental and Clinical Imaging Technologies ([EXCITE Zurich](http://www.excite.ethz.ch/)) and is the Director of Studies at the [Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.ethz.ch/).

The research of Sebastian Kozerke spans from developments in MR pulse sequence design, scan acceleration techniques, novel information encoding concepts, dynamic nuclear polarization techniques to experimental validation and clinical translation of MR methods.

Sebastian is the author of more than 250 peer-reviewed journal articles and 5 patents. He is a dedicated and enthusiastic teacher and enjoys frequent invitations to the major conferences and workshops in the field. In addition to numerous original conference contributions, he has been involved as a lecturer in workshops, educational and plenary activities.

## Computational Challenge: M&Ms-2

![]({{ "images/Mnms-2.png" | relative_url }})

This year, we only hosted one computational challenge called Multi-Disease, Multi-View & Multi-Center Right Ventricular Segmentation in Cardiac MRI Challenge organized by Carlos Martín-Isla and Karim Lekadir from the BCN-AIM, Artificial Intelligence in Medicine Lab, Universitat de Barcelona, Spain. In this challenge, we invite participants to implement and evaluate advanced approaches based on machine/deep learning for right ventricular segmentation in a multi-disease, multi-view and multi-center setting. A novel aspect of this challenge is the inclusion of long-axis images to help the automatic definition of the basal plane of the RV, which can be confused with the right atrium.
