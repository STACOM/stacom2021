The **Statistical Atlases and Computational Modeling of the Heart (STACOM)** workshop has been running annually at MICCAI since 2010. The 12th edition of STACOM workshop is going to be held in conjunction with the [MICCAI 2021](https://miccai2021.org/) in Strasbourg, France. The STACOM workshop is aiming to create a collaborative forum for young/senior researchers (engineers, biophysicists, mathematicians) and clinicians, working on: statistical analysis of cardiac morphology and dynamics, computational modelling of the heart and fluid dynamics, data/models sharing, personalisation of cardiac electro-mechanical models, quantitative image analysis and translational methods into clinical practice.
